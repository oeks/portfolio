      <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p>The retailer Lindex wanted to develop an iPad app to improve the customer experience in stores by allowing staff to place orders, look up product information, and handle customer information. They also wished that this app would make life easier for store employees. They had a vision that the solution should be easy to use and learn for the heterogeneous user group of store employees; It should appeal to both novices and the more experienced and preferably require little or no training.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>The product vision, technical opportunities, and constraints were initially explored by interviewing relevant project stakeholders. We then talked to employees of three different stores and observed how they worked in their established processes and tools to focus the design on the actual needs of both users and consumers. The choice to invest in contextual inquiries was made to collect both verbal and non-verbal information about the context of use.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>User goals were mapped out by sorting research data by recurring themes and ranked by importance to understand what features were required for the minimum viable product. Insights were shared with the project group to promote design thinking and to get everyone on board with the changes in requirements.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>User flows were first explored by wireframes critically evaluated within the project group. Prototypes were then shared and evaluated with employees in informal users tests. This incremental approach resulted in a high-resolution prototype that was handed over to the developers. This final design was made in Sketch and the prototype was maintained in InVision.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Evaluation and follow-up</h3>
        <p>The app was first released to a small group of "super users" who were encouraged to report all issues in a closed discussion forum. As the user group grew, the user experience was evaluated by an anonymous survey. Feedback from the survey was explored together with the project team in an affinity mapping workshop to encourage continued empathy for the users.</p>
