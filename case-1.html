          <h2>Brief</h2>
          <p>
            The retailer Lindex wanted to develop an iPad app to improve the
            customer experience in stores by allowing staff to place orders,
            look up product information, and handle customer information. They
            also wished that this app would make life easier for store
            employees. They had a vision that the solution should be easy to use
            and learn for the heterogeneous user group of store employees; It
            should appeal to both novices and the more experienced and
            preferably require little or no training.

          <div class="textSection">
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              The product vision, technical opportunities, and constraints were
              initially explored by interviewing relevant project stakeholders.
              We then talked to employees of three different stores and observed
              how they worked in their established processes and tools to focus
              the design on the actual needs of both users and consumers. The
              choice to invest in contextual inquiries was made to collect both
              verbal and non-verbal information about the context of use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="textSection">
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              User goals were mapped out by sorting research data by recurring
              themes and ranked by importance to understand what features were
              required for the minimum viable product. Insights were shared with
              the project group to promote design thinking and to get everyone
              on board with the changes in requirements.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="textSection">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              User flows were first explored by wireframes critically evaluated
              within the project group. Prototypes were then shared and
              evaluated in informal user tests. This incremental approach
              resulted in a high-resolution prototype that was handed over to
              the developers. This final design was made in Sketch and the
              prototype was maintained in InVision.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="textSection">
            <h3>Evaluation and follow-up</h3>
            <p>
              The app was first released to a small group of "super users" who
              were encouraged to report all issues in a closed discussion forum.
              After more users have had the chance of using the app in their
              everyday work, the UX was tracked by an anonymous survey. The
              resulting feedback was explored together with the team in an
              affinity mapping workshop. The survey let us know that the app was
              well-received but not without its issues. Outcomes of the session
              helped to further back the need of addressing some of these.

            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>
              After the initial release as work continued, the focus tended to
              sometimes wander from identified user goals to imagined goals not
              necessarily backed by research. This notion was strengthened when
              we surveyed the users and refocused on their experiences. Memory
              aids such as user personas or empathy maps might have helped the
              team in these moments to keep the focus sustained on the user.
