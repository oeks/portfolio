          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            MerxTeam supplies resellers to restaurants with kitchen-related
            products. The company wanted to change its e-commerce platform. With
            the switch and associated website redesign, they wished to shift
            more of their business to the web and to give the sales team a
            better tool for communicating with customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, there was only a vague idea of the business and
            experience goals. Therefore my main contribution to this project was
            to provide the team with tools for figuring these out and lay the
            groundwork for a goal-directed design process.

            <h3>Discovering goals</h3>
            <p>
              To get the team to start thinking about goals from the users'
              perspectives and establish a user-centric design process, we first
              set up a workshop where MerxTeam got to create a couple of
              proto-personas. They were prototypic in the sense of being based
              solely on the intuitions and experience of the participants. After
              a moment of sharing, revising, and combining, the team agreed to
              continue work on four hypothetical users. We concluded the
              exercise by collaboratively ranking the importance of each
              proto-persona from business goals that had been discussed and
              agreed on in previous meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
              To in greater detail figure out what each proto-persona would
              require from the website, our next step was to create an impact
              map. From the motivations and needs of each proto-persona, we
              reasoned about what would help them to realize these and
              contribute to identified business goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              These methods helped to create a lean UX design process focused on
              rapidly getting a minimal viable product (MVP) out for continued
              improvement.

            <h3>Project planning</h3>
            <p>
              The outcomes of the workshops were summarized in a story map -
              breaking down insights into user stories and prioritizing them for
              the MVP. The story map was also reworked into wireframes for the
              team to evaluate and to get a better view of what we would be
              building.
