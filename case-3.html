          <h2>Brief</h2>
          <p>
            The retailer Lindex wanted to improve the process for returning
            orders placed online in their stores by developing a web app that
            could be run both on a tablet and in their current Point of Sale
            (POS) system.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              Stakeholder interviews and a literature review of design
              considerations for POS systems contributed to defining basic
              requirements and constraints for the design. The existing return
              process was investigated by visiting stores and interviewing
              employees about their experiences.

          <div class="textSection">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              Early sketches of potential solutions were created with pen and
              paper (and in the wireframing tool Balsamiq as displayed above)
              and discussed together with store employees and developers in an
              effort to receive quick and honest feedback. The final design was
              made in Adobe XD and shared with developers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="textSection">
            <h3>Evaluation and follow-up</h3>
            <p>
              The app was first released to a small group of "super users" who
              were encouraged to report all issues and questions in a closed
              discussion forum. The app was generally well-received as it made
              the return process significantly easier and less time-consuming.
              The largest change after development was adding more friction to
              the return process as the perceived ease of processing returns
              could make users feel a bit anxious.
