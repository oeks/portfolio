      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The user experience undoubtedly plays a big part in how successfully a
        website manages to convert visitors into paying and returning customers.
        At Lindex, I acted as a UX resource in a Conversion Rate Optimization
        (CRO) constellation where A/B-testing as a method was used to improve
        the conversion rates in various ways.

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Research and analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Heuristic evaluations and user feedback ongoingly sparked a lot of
          ideas on improvements to the user experience. These ideas could be
          explored early together with data scientists by diving into droves of
          behavioral data such as click maps, funnels, and session recordings.
          We also had tools for surveying visitors through the website or
          through e-mails to get our hands on attitudinal data. Hypotheses could
          then be expressed as user stories and prioritized in a separate
          backlog by the group's collective confidence in them, ease of
          implementation, and estimated impact.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          Sketches and prototypes of suggested changes were shared and refined
          within the group. Minor changes were coded and reviewed directly in
          the a/b-testing tool (Google Optimize).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          Sales-related KPIs were tracked between test versions as all these
          changes had the business goal of positively affecting conversion
          rates. These findings needed to occasionally be supplemented by
          attitudinal data to ensure that users also perceived these changes to
          be improving their experiences. It was not in the group's interest to
          compromise the user experience over short-time winnings. Test results
          were subsequently shared with the larger team and changes were
          recommended for development if the hypothesis appeared to hold.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="textSection">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>
          A/B-testing appears to be an easily graspable concept for a wider
          organization as the method delivers concrete results. As such it could
          be a valuable tool for instilling a data-driven culture. On the other
          hand, it became important to contextualize the data by relating it to
          the overarching product vision and strategy.
